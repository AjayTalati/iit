% J = connectivy matrix (N x N)

% logic_type = type of logic gate for each element (N x 1); 
%       KEY: logic type: 1-> AND, 2-> OR, 3-> XOR, 4 -> COPY, 5-> NOT, 6 -> NULL

% N = number of elementary units in the system

% Na = number of afferents... not sure why you need this... couldn't it be
%       different for each element?

% p_x0 = given a state, what are the
%       values of each element at the next state (2^N x N)

% p1 = the true TPMones(2^N,2^N);

% z_max = number of states to compute over (z_max = 1 when you onl look at
%       the current state, z_max = 2^N when you compute (and average) over
%       all possible states
